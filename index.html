   <h2 style="text-align: left; font family: times"> Self-introduction and career interest </h2>
   <p> As an international student who came to UGA in 2017, I was lucky enough to find my career interest -- business in an early age. Not like many other students from China, I have planned to major in business since I was little. </p>
   <p> On September 2015, I was a sophomore in Liaoning Province high school. I am also the president of the Business Society in the school. As the president, I started up a business competition that over 500 people in my high school has participated in. In this business competition, we did stock stimulation and car sales. This experience had increased my leadership ability and enhanced interest throughout my business career. </p>
  <p> On October 2016, I had an opportunity to intern in the Agricultural Bank of China limited(ABC). During this internship, my supervisor leads me to watch the operation of the bank and taught me business and communication techniques of how to make our clients satisfied with the bank product and service. I realized that doing business is something I truly loved. Therefore, during my senior year, I searched for schools that has better business programs than others. </p>
  <p> On August 2017, I entered the university of Georgia as an intended business major and I started to take classes in the business field. I will stay here to finish my bachelorsâ€™ degree as a business major student and pursing business-related career in the future. </p>
